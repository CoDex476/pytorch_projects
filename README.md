# PyTorch Projects

A collection of PyTorch projects to practice and showcase core deep learning concepts.

## About
This repository will contain hands-on deep learning projects implemented with PyTorch.  
Planned topics include:

- Tabular data
- Image classification
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Audio classification
- Text classification

Each project will be accompanied by well-documented Jupyter notebooks for learning and experimentation.

## Dataset
The Rice Type Classification dataset is available on Kaggle:  
[Rice Type Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/rice-type-classification)

**Note:** The CSV is not included in this repo.  
Download it and place it in the `data/` folder before running the notebook.

## Status
ðŸš§ Work in progress â€“ projects will be added step by step.
